# PROJECT TITLE

**Course:** (e.g., DATA 513 – Classification)  
**Skills:** Python • Pandas • Scikit-learn • (add more)  
**Repo:** (link to GitHub repo)  
**Notebook:** (link to notebook if separate)

---

## 1) Problem

What question are you answering? What decision could this improve?

**Example:** Predict customer churn to prioritize retention outreach.

---

## 2) Data

- **Source:** (Kaggle/UCI/etc.)
- **Rows / Columns:**
- **Target / Label:**
- **Key features:**

### Data cleaning

- Missing values strategy
- Outlier handling
- Encoding
- Train/validation split strategy

---

## 3) Exploratory Data Analysis

Show 3–6 key visuals:

- Target balance
- Correlations / distributions
- Important segment differences

**Key insights:**

- Bullet points, short & punchy

---

## 4) Modeling

### Baseline

- Simple baseline model + metric

### Final models tried

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost (optional)

### Feature engineering

- What you created and why

---

## 5) Evaluation

- Metrics: (ROC-AUC, F1, Precision/Recall)
- Confusion matrix
- Threshold choice (and why)

**Business framing:**  
Explain cost trade-offs: false positives vs false negatives.

---

## 6) Results & Takeaways

- Best model + final metrics
- What mattered most (top features / drivers)
- What would you do differently with more time?

---

## 7) Next Steps (Production-minded)

- Monitoring plan
- Data drift risks
- Retraining approach
- Deployment idea (API / batch scoring)
